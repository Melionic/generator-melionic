## Getting Started

A few options are available:

-   Download the latest [release](https://github.com/reedia/Melionic/archive/v1.0.35.zip)
-   Or simply clone the main repo: `git clone https://github.com/reedia/Melionic.git`

## What's in the box

Within the release you'll find the following directory and external style sheets with both compiled and minified CSS variations:

```
Melionic/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melionic-1.0.35.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melionic.min-1.0.35.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melionic-colours-1.0.35.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melionic-colours.min-1.0.35.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melionic-pattern-1.0.35.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Melionic-pattern.min-1.0.35.css
```

You simply then need to link one of these in your HTML document.

The link consists of just a simple line of HTML code that you will need to put in the ```<head>```  section of your HTML document:

#### Default CSS

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Melionic.min-1.0.35.css" />
```

#### CSS Responsive Grid-View
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Melionic-pattern.min-1.0.35.css" />
```

#### CSS Colours
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Melionic-colours.min-1.0.35.css" />
```

We offer production-ready versions and use unpkg as our CDN to link to the latest production version

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/Melionic" />
